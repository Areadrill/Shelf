# Shelf

This is the home repo for the mobile app that will allow you to explore the world of books.

This will initially be an educational repo for [Hacktoberefest 2023](https://hacktoberfest.com/) and hopefully at the end we will have developed a working app.

To contribute, simply follow the best practices and guidelines provided by [hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#beginner-resources)

This is a light hearted project, there are no strict rules to follow for contribution. Just play nice and support each other!

Happy Coding!
